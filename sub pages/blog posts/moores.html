  <P>A serious possible factor in the future of cryptology is Moore's law.  Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The implications for cryptology are innumerable, the exponential growth of computing power allows for more complex algorithms to be used to secure data. It also presents other issues or benefits depending on your perspective, the increased power also allows for more efficient encryption cracking methods which is beneficial for code cracking purposes. This also creates an artificial arms race of encryption schemes being made more complicated and secure to protect against more capable code breaking machines; this helps with protecting consumers and creating jobs to keep pushing the limits of data protection. A possible issue with Moore's law is the possible maximum transistor density. You can't simply make a computer chip bigger because the greater space between components increases latency and increases signal degradation over distance. The only solution is to find the optimal latency to size ratio for a chip to make it as dense as possible, but another problem arises. The chip manufacturing techniques have a certain limit where the current lithography techniques would make increasingly unreliable chips. Even if a method of making reliable and increasingly dense transistors was discovered there's a huge hard block to the current structuring of integrated circuits. Eventually these transistors will reach the size of mere atoms; and then the transistors experience a complex phenomena known as quantum tunneling where electrons have a probability of passing through an energy insulator causing irregular behavior. This future is speeding towards us faster than you can imagine; Intel and TSMC have projected to have 1nm transistor fabrication before 2030, for scale a atom can be anywhere from 0.5 to 0.1 nm. The future is bright for cryptology nonetheless, to negate the hard stop on computational security brought by computers we can work on optimizing them. The world needs more cryptographers!</P>
